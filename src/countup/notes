5. Countup
  Display numerical data in an interesting way by adding in some animations
  (for analytics dashboard type of application)
  The number starts from 0 & animate towards to actual value to be displayed.

  react-countup
  import CountUp from "react-countup";

  'end' prop on CountUp component which will be equal to a number
  This value indicated the value at which the animation has to stop.
  Ex: <CountUp end={200} />

  NOTE: default duration of the animation is 2s.
  However it is configurable using the duration prop.

  What might be the initial value for the animation?
  - zero
    It can be controlled using the 'start' prop on the CountUp component.

  
  How to manually start, stop & pause a CounUp component?
  - to able to do this we need to use the 'hook' implementation of the CountUp component.

  NOTE: setting 'startOnMount: false' in the hook,
  stops the countup to run when the component is loaded at first
