4. Tooltips
  - tippy.js-react
  npm install --save '@tippy.js/react'

  import Tippy from '@tippy.js/react'
  Also import the core CSS,
  import 'tippy.js/dist/tippy.css'

  To add a Tooltip to an element we simply wrap the element with Tippy component.

  Variations on a Tippy component 'content' prop:
    'content' prop to the component - Tooltip content
    'content' prop can also accept HTML elements.
    We can also specify 'react element' as content.

  
  Children component:
  It is possible to specify an other react component as the Children or child to the Tippy component.
  NOTE:
    If we want to use a custom component as a child, we need to forward the 'ref' to the DOM node.
    i.e., import { forwardRef } from 'react';
    Next, wrap the arrow function (component) with forwardRef
      i.e., pass the component as an arg to the forwardRef() function.

  
  Some important props on Tippy component:
  1. arrow prop
    basically determines whether the Tooltip has an arrow or not.

  2. delay prop
    adds a delay to both showing & hiding of the Tooltip

  3. placement prop
    to decide the place for the Tooltip
    default Tooltip placement is to the top of the element
    however if there is no place at the top, it will be rendered at the bottom. (automatically handled by the library)

    possible values: left, right, top, bottom
